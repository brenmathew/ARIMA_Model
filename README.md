# ARIMA Sales Forecasting
This repository contains an ARIMA sales forecasting model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular time series forecasting technique used to predict future values based on historical data patterns.

The main component of this repository is the Arima_Sales.ipynb notebook. This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the ARIMA model for sales forecasting. It includes the following sections:

1. Data Preprocessing: This section involves loading and preparing the sales data for analysis. It includes steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for the ARIMA model.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Here, the notebook explores the sales data by visualizing it through various plots and statistical summaries. This helps in understanding the underlying patterns and trends present in the data.

3. ARIMA Model: This section covers the implementation of the ARIMA model for sales forecasting. It includes the identification of model parameters (order of differencing, autoregressive and moving average terms), model fitting, and model evaluation.

4. Forecasting: Using the trained ARIMA model, this section demonstrates how to make future sales predictions. It includes generating forecasts for a specified time period and visualizing the predicted sales values.

# Usage
To use the ARIMA sales forecasting model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook (Arima_Sales.ipynb) directly.

2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python development environment.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, analyze it, and train the ARIMA model.

5. Once the model is trained, you can make sales predictions by running the forecast cells in the notebook.
